    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we’ll use some of the techniques from the previous weeks (functions, array slicing, ODEs, ...) to see how to solve numerically for the motion of two bodies which attract each other through a gravitational force. While we can use `odeint()` from last week, we will go into some details of numerical solvers, and see which is applicable when by implementing our own solvers. They could then be compared with the ones available in `odeint()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gravitational force example in this sheet can be extended to several bodies, and since both gravitational and electrostatic forces have a $1/r^2$ distance dependence, the methods used here can be applied also to the case of a number of interacting charged objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "A numerical study is important since only the very simplest cases have an analytic solution - even just three interacting bodies cannot in general be solved analytically. We first look at the simplest analytically solvable case, that of circular orbits, which you met in PX1121 last year.\n",

    "## Circular Newtonian orbits - revision\n",

    "If two bodies are separated by a distance $r$ and interact through gravity, then the force $\\mathbf{F_G}$ acting on a body of mass $m$ due to a body of mass $M$ is:\n",

    "\n",
    "We shall take the case where the mass $m \\ll M$ to simplify the subsequent equations. So we can treat the position of mass M as fixed at the origin. (To solve the more general case analytically, the concept of reduced mass needs to be introduced, which you will meet in another module.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different possible paths or 'orbits' that the small mass can take, depending on its _initial conditions_. In general it will follow an elliptical orbit of size and eccentricity which can be calculated knowing these initial conditions $\\mathbf{r}_0$ and $\\mathbf{v}_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the special case of circular motion, the initial velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0$ is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{r}_0$ and of the correct magnitude to produce an exactly circular orbit. The centripetal force acting on $m$ is\n",

We then repeat this for subsequent time steps. Let’s see three methods by which this can be done:\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An even better method is ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## III Verlet method\n",
    "\n",
    "This was popularised by Loup Verlet in 1967 (although first discovered two centuries before) for molecular dynamics simulations. It is very important nowadays for calculating such things as the interaction of large molecules (e.g. for developing theraputic drugs).\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, this is called the 'velocity Verlet' method. (It is closely related to the so-called 'leapfrog' method.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So you need to evaluate the acceleration $\\mathbf{a}$ at the current point (time $t$) and the next point (time $t+\\Delta t$). Since $\\mathbf{a}$ depends only on position $\\mathbf{r}$ in our case of orbits, this is straightforward because the next position is calculated in the first line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clever thing about the integrator is that it is time-reversible, and this means that the energy of the system is in principle exactly (not just approximately) conserved. This leads to huge improvements in accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to program these methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you are still a little unsure about using functions, _now_ is the time to revise, ask a demonstrator, and go to office hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement and compare the above methods you should create a general `orbit_solve` function, that will solve your equations for any choice of initial conditions `r0` and `v0`, integration time `tmax` , number of integration points `N` , and (eventually) choice of numerical method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\mathbf{r}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are vectors, we write their x- and y-components with the help of a numpy array. The initial conditions `r0` and `v0` will each be length-2 numpy arrays (representing the 2D vectors) that contains the initial position and initial velocity vectors. For example"
